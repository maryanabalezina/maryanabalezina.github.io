## Ask me about...
Despite currently focusing on trans* attitudes and sports policies, I am still very passionate about other issues discussed in social science. I'm very willing to (yap) discuss following themes in a more casual manner:

- History of sexuality in light of colonialism
- Homonationalism and its application in CEE
- Identity politics, radical queer rights, and the neoliberal subjects
